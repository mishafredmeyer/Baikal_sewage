### Abstract
Treated and untreated sewage released from lakeside development can introduce
nutrients and micropollutants and restructure aquatic ecosystems. Lake Baikal,
the world’s most ancient, biodiverse, and voluminous lake, has been
experiencing localized sewage pollution from lakeside settlements, near which
increasing filamentous algal abundance has suggested that littoral benthic
communities are responding. We surveyed 40-km of Baikal’s southwestern
shoreline 19-23 August 2015 for sewage indicators, including pharmaceuticals
and microplastics with co-located periphyton and macroinvertebrate relative
abundance and indicators of food web structure (stable isotopes and
fatty acids). Unique identifiers corresponding to sampling locations are
retained throughout all data files to facilitate interoperability among the
dataset’s 125 variables. The data are structured in a tidy format (a tabular
arrangement familiar to limnologists) to encourage future reuse. For Baikal,
these data can supplement continued monitoring efforts. For lakes worldwide,
these data can help synthesize sewage prevalence, intensity, and ecological
consequences across spatial scales.

# Directory information and structure
This main directory contains three subdirectories, each with their own version
of the SIBER dataset.
1. `original_data`: Raw, unaggregated data that may have misspellings, some
taxa that were poorly preserved, and some misidentified taxa. These data
are cleaned and aggregated by script `00_disaggregated_data_cleaning.R`.
2. `clean_disaggregated_data`: Data are cleaned, standardized, and aggregated
to the replicate-level. These are available on the Environmental Data
Initiative (DOI) portal.
3. `cleaned_data`: Site-level aggregated data that have been cleaned and
aggregated with script `01_data_cleaning.R`.

# Scripts and workflow

## Scripts in this repository
Scripts that are central to the linear workflow of the SIBER build process are
numbered consecutively.

 1. `00_disaggregated_data_cleaning.R`: Aggregate datasets to replicate-level,
remove poorly preserved or misidentified taxa, and correct spelling
  + Inputs: Disaggregated, replicate level raw CSVs
  + Outputs: Replicate-level CSVs for each type of data collected within a new
 directory
 2. `01_data_cleaning.R`: Aggregate datasets to site-level for analyses
  + Inputs: Disaggregated, replicate level CSVs and KML file derived from
  Google Earth project
